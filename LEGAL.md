### IMPORTANT
This repository contains code that remains licensed under MIT regardless of the date, this only applies to changes we have made separate from our upstream, https://github.com/space-wizards/space-station-14.
Any code we have licensed under AGPLv3 will have this clearly marked in the first line of the file, and in the case of changes in files that arent ours, before and after the change.
If a file does not explicitly relicense itself as AGPLv3, it is to be assumed that it is still under MIT.

Note: We may make changes in within files that are licensed under MIT. These modifications will contain a notice if they are licensed under AGPLv3.
