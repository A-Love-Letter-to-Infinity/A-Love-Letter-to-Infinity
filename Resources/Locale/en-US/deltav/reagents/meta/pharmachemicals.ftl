reagent-name-sodiumamalgam = sodium amalgam
reagent-desc-sodiumamalgam = Comes from an exothermic reaction to sodium and mercury. Really ugly.

reagent-name-barbituricacid = barbituric acid
reagent-desc-barbituricacid = Odorless reagent, barbituric acid itself is not pharmacologically active on its own. Legend says its name comes from "Barbara".

reagent-name-benzenesulfonicacid = benzenesulfonic acid
reagent-desc-benzenesulfonicacid = A strongly acidic reagent, a mix of benzene and sulfuric acid.

reagent-name-sodiumphenolate = sodium phenolate
reagent-desc-sodiumphenolate = Precursor to many other organic compounds, such as salicylic acid, it can also be called sodium phenoxide, for intimate discussions...

reagent-name-salicylicacid = salicylic acid
reagent-desc-salicylicacid = A teratogen, from the Latin salix, which means willow tree. It was used as an ingredient in anti-acne reagents.

reagent-name-methanol = methanol
reagent-desc-methanol = Also might have heard your mother call it wood spirit, this is way more toxic than regular ethanol.

reagent-name-methylsalicylate = methyl salicylate
reagent-desc-methylsalicylate = This reagent is more often used to flavor your mint candies than chugged from the jug.

reagent-name-hydrogenchloride = hydrogen chloride
reagent-desc-hydrogenchloride = Also called chlorane, (HCl) is also a light diatomic molecule involved with the formation of hydrochloric acid, which is made on contact with the body

reagent-name-hydrochloricacid = hydrochloric acid
reagent-desc-hydrochloricacid = Forms whenever hydrogen chloride enters in contact with water, you don't want that in your stomach...

reagent-name-aceticanhydride = acetic anhydride
reagent-desc-aceticanhydride = Acetic anhydride is a carboxylic acid anhydride commonly used for the acetylation of amines and alcohols... it's used to make more complex reagents for the big picture.

reagent-name-aceticacid = acetic acid
reagent-desc-aceticacid = Historically used to make vinegar, acetic acid, or ethanoic acid, this reagent was a big lap in modern technologies we know today.

reagent-name-acetylchloride = acetyl chloride
reagent-desc-acetylchloride = Derived from acetic acid, this reagent is used for esterfication and the Friedel-Crafts reaction, but that's really nerdy.
