spaceferret-role-greeting =
    I've been sent by my tribe to the surface to scavenge, and now I'm hungry and alone. :(
    I need to eat a bunch of nutrients and find a safe place to hibernate!
    Hopefully these strange tall creatures don't notice me.

spaceferret-role-briefing = You're a small, potentially-innocent creature lost on a big, scary space station. Eat as much food as you need to hibernate, then hibernate in a gas scrubber. You have no time limit, but leaving on the evac shuttle does NOT count as a draw or lesser success. Your hibernating body does not need to survive the remaining round, so feel free to clock out once you've had your fun.

petting-failure-spaceferret = You reach out to pet {THE($target)}, but {SUBJECT($target)} does a backflip!

We suggest you act adorable, are helpful, or become extremely robust. Go live your best life, wawa.
