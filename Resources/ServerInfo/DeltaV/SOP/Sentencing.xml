  # Sentencing

  In sentencing a crime, it is recommended to defer to the Warden or Head of Security; however, any Security Officer is authorised to pass a sentence. If no security staff are available, the commanding officer or any head of department may be authorised to pass a sentence.

  Additionally, if the total sentence would exceed 20 minutes, the sentencing officer is [italic]fully authorised[/italic] to [italic]upgrade the sentence[/italic] to Extended Confinement at their own discretion. Once the sentence commences, it must be concluded at or before the agreed time; however, the convict may be held responsible for any crime they commit while serving their sentence.
