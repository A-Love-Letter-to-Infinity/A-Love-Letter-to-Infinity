  Whereas a defendant is placed on trial, they are granted the privilege to challenge the legitimacy of charges or claims brought against them by the legal process. Any of the following may be invoked:

  - [bold]Issue Preclusion/Double Jeopardy Clause[/bold]: accused persons may not be tried on the same charges following an acquittal or conviction, except in the case of acquittal and subsequent credible admission of guilt.
  - [bold]Entrapment Clause[/bold]: accused persons found to be induced or coerced by law enforcement into the commission of the crimes listed in the charges may be acquitted or have their sentence reduced.
  - [bold]Exclusionary Clause[/bold]: evidence collected and/or analysed in violation of accused persons’ rights under law may be inadmissible in court.
