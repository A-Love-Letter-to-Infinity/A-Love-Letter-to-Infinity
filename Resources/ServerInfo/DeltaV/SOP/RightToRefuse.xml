  # Right to Refuse Service

  All standard service members that operate within a secure area are given the right to refuse service to patrons at any time if they are disorderly or abusive, or, in the case of service of alcoholic beverages, if they are suspected of being intoxicated. Additionally, all standard service members are permitted to use nonlethal force to remove noncompliant, intoxicated, or disorderly individuals only when such persons pose a threat to the safety of staff members, or disrupt the orderly functioning of the secure areas and staff quarters.

  All medical staff may, at any time, refuse medical care to patients for any of the following reasons:
  - Lack of expertise; the medical staff does not have the necessary skill, knowledge, or capability to provide treatment.
  - Illegal or unethical request; the medical staff cannot in good conscience provide treatment due to illegality or violation of ethical principles.
  - Patient refusal; the patient, being legally competent to make such a decision, refuses treatment.
  - Disruptive or abusive patient; the patient exhibits violent or threatening behaviour, posing a danger to staff and to other patients.
  - Resource constraints; there are limited resources available to medical staff, necessitating allocation by triage.
