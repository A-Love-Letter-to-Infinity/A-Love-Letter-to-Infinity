  # Medical Evaluation
  Given good medical reason and with documentation, the [color=lightblue]Chief Medical Officer[/color] of a vessel may declare any on-duty personnel unfit for duty and order them to be demoted from their position; this includes the Commanding Officer, who may not overrule this procedure.

  In order for a medical evaluation to be considered lawfully applicable, the [color=lightblue]CMO[/color] and the relevant head of department must both agree that the specified crewmate is unfit for duty for the demotion for it to take effect.
