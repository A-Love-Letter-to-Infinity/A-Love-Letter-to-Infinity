  # Authority

  The commanding officer or CO of a commercial or military vessel is afforded several rights that are as follows:

  The CO of such a vessel is granted the authority to personally execute any member of their crew, unless they are already in custody of its security, under the following circumstances:
  - The crew member exhibits a clear and present danger to the chain of command by illegal means.
  - The crew member exhibits a clear and present danger to the health and safety of an officer.
  - The crew member exhibits a clear and present danger to the vessel by physical means.

  The CO of such a vessel is additionally granted the authority to personally pardon and/or parole individuals accused and sentenced for crimes if deemed in the best interest of the crew and the vessel. Only misdemeanour and felony crimes may be pardoned, and the CO may be held legally responsible for criminal acts committed by those who they pardon. Whenever any pardon is granted, a general announcement must be made detailing who was pardoned, for which crimes, and for what reason.

  Additionally, and most importantly, the CO of such a vessel is granted [bold]Captain’s Authority[/bold] over their vessel, in that while they are the formally and legally appointed **Captain**, they are the [italic]highest-ranking officer[/italic] aboard the vessel until they are directly dismissed by a superior.

  This carries a responsibility, however; the Captain of the vessel [italic]must do everything possible[/italic] to save the passengers, crew, and assets aboard the station, and, unless their life is in immediate danger, must not abandon ship if there is reasonable hope that it could be saved.

  Failure to “go down with the ship” or to make an attempt to save the vessel up until the last available moment will forfeit the Captain’s right to invoke Dire Emergency and will result in their demotion, dismissal, or even termination.
