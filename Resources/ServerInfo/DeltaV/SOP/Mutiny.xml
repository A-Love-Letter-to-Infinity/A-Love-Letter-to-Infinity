  # Mutiny

  Should such a situation arise in which the CO is unfit for their position and declines relinquishment of position and power, and where all alternative legal options have been exhausted, officers may be permitted to lead a mutiny.

  A mutiny, defined as a coordinated effort to depose the commanding officer or officers of a vessel for committing unlawful acts, requires the crew to neutralise the offending staff with non-lethal force where applicable, and lethal measures and weapons only in acts of self-preservation or when given no other option. The commanding officer or officers, as well as their loyalists, are all bound to Space Law, the current Alert Procedure and it's corresponding RoE.

  - Should the mutiny be [color=#9a2a2a]unsuccessful[/color], [bold]only the head officer(s) who approved the mutiny[/bold] may receive an execution sentencing, while all mutineers may be demoted and/or placed in Extended Confinement.
  - Should the mutiny be [color=#2a9a2a]successful[/color], the head officer(s) who approved the mutiny may select a new commanding officer, who will sentence the previous heads of staff for their crimes at their own discretion and per Space Law.
