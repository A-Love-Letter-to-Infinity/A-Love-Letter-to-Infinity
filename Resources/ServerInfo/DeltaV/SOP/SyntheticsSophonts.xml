  # Synthetics and Sophonts

  A sophont is described as any entity with the capacity to display the following attributes:

  - Sapience: the entity possesses basic logic and problem-solving skills, or at a minimum some level of significant intelligence; the ability to think, or to act logically.
  - Sentience: the entity has the capacity to process an emotion or lack thereof, or at a minimum the ability to recognise its own pain; the ability to feel, or respond to stimuli.
  - Self-awareness: the entity is capable of altering its behaviour in a reasonable fashion as a result of stimuli, or at a minimum is capable of recognising its own sapience and sentience; the ability to grow and change, or to exhibit neuroplastic-similar behaviour.

  Any synthetic/silicon/inorganic entity, including but not limited to robots, cyborgs, and drones, and with a non-sophont status, is to be classified as a standard synthetic entity. Synthetic entities are the property of the party that constructs or employs the entity, unless otherwise stated by relevant contract or legal document. To damage or destroy such an entity is to damage or destroy the aforementioned party’s property.

  Any synthetic/silicon/inorganic sophont is considered a legal person, regardless of their origin or prior cognitive status. Much like any other intelligent organic, they may press charges against crew and be tried for crimes themselves. That being said, unauthorised jailbreaking of privately-owned synthetic entities is an offence, and those found guilty of doing so may be charged with sabotage.
