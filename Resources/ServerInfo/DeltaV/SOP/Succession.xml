  # Line of succession

  If the CO dies and is unrecoverable, a new CO must be selected per the following guide:

  - Step 1: Is the CO still alive? If so, proceed to step 5. If not, then proceed to the next step.
  - Step 2: All head officers currently alive may vote on a head to make the new CO; proceed to step 5. If no head officers remain, proceed to the next step.
  - Step 3: Make your way to bridge and seek evacuation, set the alert level to red, and make a general announcement. If you succeed, you are now the de facto Captain and may proceed to step 5. If you are unable to fulfil any of the above, proceed to the next step.
  - Step 4: Seek a safe place to shelter and await rescue. If there is a present danger aboard the vessel, make all possible efforts to avoid it.
  - Step 5: Await the end of your shift.
