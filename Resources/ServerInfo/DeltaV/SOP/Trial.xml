  # Trial Procedure

  A trial may only be requested for felonies, civil disputes, and capital crimes; while trials for felonies and disputes may be refused depending on the availability and discretion of the potential judge, capital crimes necessitate a mandatory trial. While legal counsel is not required, if it is available then it must be provided upon request.

  The trial takes the format of an arbitration court hearing, presided by a fair and impartial judge; typically, a lawyer or head of department. Should no eligible members be available, a member of the crew may be elected to the position of arbiter by unanimous vote between defence and prosecution. If no judge or arbiter is available, the current commanding officer aboard the station must preside over the legal proceedings.

  In this hearing, the judge directly examines both the defendant and a representative of the prosecution to present their case on why the defendant should be either cleared or convicted of their charges. Prosecution begins the proceedings, defence following at the discretion of the judge. Ideally, the trial should last no longer than 10 minutes, with either part taking fewer than five minutes to present their case. Extensions may only be requested with reason, and are granted at discretion of the judge.

  Should witness testimony be requested by either defence or prosecution, and the relevant witness be willing and capable of appearing before court, such testimony may be admissible in a trial.

  In the event that the defendant is held in contempt of court, the necessity of a trial may be waived and sentence passed by the judge or arbiter without a full hearing.
