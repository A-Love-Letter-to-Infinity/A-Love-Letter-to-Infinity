# Pharmacist
The "crème de la crème" in terms of knowledge in chemistry, the Pharmacist is the best at its domain! That they studied at Interdyne Pharmaceutics or at the Andromeda Initiative Laboratories, their valuable knowledge is to be respected.
They sacrifice the general purpose of Chemistry to the indomitable world of pharmaceutics, working more closely to the crew, the psychologist, medical doctors that actually do check-ups, atmospheric technicians, ...
The Pharmacist is a social role, where social interactions are needed if you wish to excell at handing out prescriptions.

## You're on your own!

The Pharmacist runs his own booth, where people can checkout or ask for a prescription. You are sort of a store-keep in some way.
Use your lab's design to your advantage, having a storefront, and a lab behind it!

## Prescriptions

The Pharmacist has access to unique items, his own stamp, and prescriptions.

Write your prescription template, hand out to doctors, stamp it for legal reasons and make copies! Your job is half-reagent half-paperwork! What a nightmare!
Your PDA has an built-in scanner, so don't worry about rushing to medbay and ask what's wrong with someone.

## Pharmaceutic Reagents

A lot of the reagents the Pharmacist has to deal with are hard to synthetize, a lot of them need a lot of refining, and overall a lot of ressources, so try to be as noble and humble on your dosage, or harrass logistics for more!
